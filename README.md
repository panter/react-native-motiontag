# react-native-motiontag

Turbo Module wrapping the [MotionTag tracking SDK](https://motion-tag.com/) for
React Native (new architecture only).

The JS surface mirrors the [official Flutter SDK](https://github.com/MOTIONTAG/motiontag-sdk-flutter)
so payloads are interchangeable. Bridges the iOS SDK v6.5.x and the Android
SDK v7.2.x — the platform asymmetry is hidden behind a shared TS contract.

## Install in your app

```sh
yarn add react-native-motiontag
# or:  npm install react-native-motiontag
```

Then follow **either** the Expo path (recommended) or the bare React Native
path below — pick the one that matches your project.

## Public API

```ts
import MotionTag from 'react-native-motiontag'

await MotionTag.setUserToken(jwt)
await MotionTag.start()
const active = await MotionTag.isTrackingActive()
await MotionTag.stop()

const subscription = MotionTag.addListener(event => {
  if (event.type === 'transmissionError' && event.errorCode === 401) {
    // re-auth flow
  }
})
subscription.remove()
```

`addListener` supports multiple subscribers; each `addListener` returns its
own `EventSubscription`. The `MotionTagEvent` discriminated union covers
`started`, `stopped`, `location`, `transmissionSuccess`, `transmissionError`,
`authorization` (iOS), `powerSaveModeChanged` (Android),
`batteryOptimizationsChanged` (Android), and a fall-through `log` channel
that carries the diagnostic string format the underlying SDKs emit.

The platform-only methods (`isPowerSaveModeEnabled`,
`isBatteryOptimizationsEnabled` on Android; `getWifiOnlyDataTransfer` /
`setWifiOnlyDataTransfer` / `clearData` on Android) resolve to safe defaults
(`false`) or reject (`'UNSUPPORTED'`) on iOS, matching the Flutter SDK's
behaviour.

## Setup with Expo (recommended)

The package ships an Expo config plugin that wires up everything for you on
`expo prebuild`: AppDelegate bootstrap (iOS), MainApplication bootstrap
(Android), `Info.plist` permission + background-mode keys, foreground-service
notification factory, the Azure DevOps Maven repo, and the extra Android
permissions (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`).

Add the plugin to `app.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "expo": {
    "newArchEnabled": true,
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-motiontag",
        {
          "iosPermissions": {
            "locationAlwaysAndWhenInUse": "We use your location to track your trips.",
            "locationWhenInUse": "We use your location to track your trips.",
            "motion": "We use motion data to detect transport modes."
          },
          "androidNotification": {
            "channelId": "motiontag_tracking",
            "channelName": "Tracking",
            "title": "MyApp",
            "text": "Tracking is active"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

Then run `npx expo prebuild --clean` followed by `npx expo run:ios` /
`npx expo run:android`. Expo Go is not supported — the library has native
code, you need a development client build.

## Setup with bare React Native

The MotionTag SDKs need to be initialised **before React Native starts**.
Turbo modules are instantiated lazily on first JS access, so they cannot run
this themselves — the host app must call a small bootstrap from its
`AppDelegate` (iOS) and `Application.onCreate` (Android).

### iOS — `AppDelegate.swift`

```swift
import RNMotionTag

func application(
  _ application: UIApplication,
  didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil
) -> Bool {
  MotionTagBootstrap.bootstrap(launchOptions: launchOptions)
  // … rest of RN bootstrap …
}

func application(
  _ application: UIApplication,
  handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession identifier: String,
  completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void
) {
  MotionTagBootstrap.processBackgroundSessionEvents(
    identifier: identifier,
    completionHandler: completionHandler
  )
}
```

The host's `Info.plist` must declare:

- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`,
  `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSMotionUsageDescription` —
  user-facing copy stays host-owned.
- `UIBackgroundModes` containing `location`, `fetch`, `processing`.
- `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` containing
  `com.motiontag.sdk.backgroundrefresh` and
  `com.motiontag.sdk.backgroundtask` (required from SDK 6.5.0).
- `FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled = false` if the app uses Firebase,
  so its swizzling doesn't interfere with MotionTag's background URLSession.

### Android — `Application.onCreate`

```kotlin
import de.motiontag.reactnative.MotionTagBootstrap

override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    loadReactNative(this)
    MotionTagBootstrap.init(this, createNotification())
}
```

The host owns the foreground-service `Notification` (channel id, title,
text, icon) — the package does not impose copy or branding. Required
SDK permissions (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`,
`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`, `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`,
`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`) are merged into the host manifest by Gradle.

## Pre-RN events

Events that fire between native init (in `MotionTagBootstrap.init` /
`MotionTagBootstrap.bootstrap`) and the JS subscription being installed are
**dropped** — only the diagnostic log line goes to logcat / Console. In
practice this is rare and only affects authorization-status changes; the
3-second polling reconciler in `useTrackingChecks` re-establishes state.

## Native dependency versions

| Platform | Version | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | `MotionTagSDK ~> 6.5.0` | CocoaPods trunk (transitive from this pod) |
| Android | `de.motiontag:tracker:7.2.5` | `pkgs.dev.azure.com/motiontag/releases` (Maven repo declared in this package) |

The two SDKs are intentionally out of sync — aligning them is tracked as
a follow-up.

## Running the example app

The `example/` folder is a working Expo dev-client app that exercises the
package end-to-end: paste a JWT, request permissions, start tracking, watch
events stream in.

**Requirements**: Node 18+, Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android. Expo
Go won't work — the package has native code, so you need a development
client build.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaymaycry/react-native-motiontag
cd react-native-motiontag
yarn install                       # installs root devDeps + runs `bob build`
cd example
yarn install                       # installs Expo deps + links the parent
npx expo prebuild --clean          # runs the config plugin, generates ios/ + android/
npx expo run:ios                   # build + boot iOS simulator
# or
npx expo run:android               # needs an Android emulator running first
```

After the first run, the dev loop is:

```sh
cd example
npx expo start --dev-client        # Metro only; reuses the installed app
```

Press `r` to reload the JS bundle. Edits to `App.tsx`, `src/`, or the
library's `src/index.ts` hot-reload via Fast Refresh. Native (Swift/Kotlin)
edits require another `expo run:ios` / `expo run:android`.

For real motion-tracking validation use a physical device
(`npx expo run:ios --device`) — simulators can't generate motion-sensor
data and only fake locations via Xcode's debug-location menu / the Android
emulator's location controls.

## Repo layout

```
react-native-motiontag/
├── src/                 # TS source (the JS API surface)
├── android/             # Android Turbo Module (Kotlin, AAR)
├── ios/                 # iOS Turbo Module (Swift + ObjC++)
├── plugin/              # Expo config plugin (plain JS, no build)
├── app.plugin.js        # Plugin entrypoint loaded by `expo prebuild`
├── react-native-motiontag.podspec
├── package.json         # Published npm package
└── example/             # Standalone Expo demo app consuming the package
```

The library and the example are independent npm packages. The example
declares the parent via a relative path:

```json
{ "dependencies": { "react-native-motiontag": "file:.." } }
```

When you `yarn install` in `example/`, that resolves as a symlink to the
parent — edit library source and changes show up in the example without a
re-install.

## Developing the package

- **Build the library**: `yarn install` at the root runs `react-native-builder-bob`
  via the `prepare` script. Output lands in `lib/{commonjs,module,typescript}`.
  These are produced for npm consumers; the example uses `src/` directly via
  the `react-native` field in `package.json`.
- **Type-check the source**: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit`.
- **Dedup peer deps**: `react`/`react-native` are installed both at the root
  (devDeps, for `bob build` + tsc) and in `example/` (runtime). Metro is
  configured in `example/metro.config.js` to block the root copies and
  redirect every `'react-native'` / `'react'` import to the example's copy
  — a single physical instance at runtime.
- **`.npmrc` at root** sets `legacy-peer-deps=true` so npm doesn't try to
  auto-install our declared peers when someone runs `npm install` at the
  library root.
- **Iterate on the Expo config plugin** by editing files in `plugin/` and
  re-running `npx expo prebuild --clean` in `example/`. The injected blocks
  are wrapped in `@generated` markers and de-duplicated on re-run.
